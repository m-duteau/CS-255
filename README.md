# CS-255
Included are Business Requirements document and System Requirements document for a system developed for DriverPass, a driver's education company.
The system was developed in order to create an online client that can be utilized by both students and DriverPass personnel.
The system allows students to create an account, reserve driving sessions, purchase packages, and access online learning based on which package has been purchased.
The documents do well in including the many different aspects that are required of the system and explaining the importance and purpose of each aspect.
Sequence diagram and class diagram need improvement.
Sequence diagram should include better formatting to note alternative processes.
Class diagram should have included a separate class that pertains to the different packages that DriverPass will be offering.
Attention was given in making sure that user priveleges and security were pertinent aspects of the system.
Aspects such as these are important, as they guard personal information that the users may provide to the system in order to complete certain tasks.
Security is particularly important, as students who utilize the system may provide their address and payment methods, which are very sensitive information.
While the company's needs were taken into consideration, I believe future iterations of such documentation should be more thorough.
Certain diagrams could be greatly improved upon, and some of the requirements of the system may have been amiss or could have been better explained or built upon.
